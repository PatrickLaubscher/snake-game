# :snake: Snake game

Snake game coded in **vanilla JavaScript** with keyboard controls and retro gaming design.

We used 2 JavaScript APIs: 
- **Canvas API** ‚Üí drawings & animations.
- **Web Audio API** ‚Üí the sound design.


## :video_game: Play the game

Choose a difficulty and click on "Start".

Use the arrow key directions on your keyboard to move the snake. The goal is to eat as many flowers as you can.

You can reset the game at any time by clicking on "Replay".

### Rules Reminder
- The goal is to eat food (e.g., apples, flowers, dots) that appears randomly on the grid.
- Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and the score increases.
- The game ends if the snake:
    - hits the walls (border of the play area), or
    - runs into its own body.

- The challenge is to survive as long as possible while making the snake as long as you can.
